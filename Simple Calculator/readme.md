## Encryptix Internship Calculator Task

This project leverages the Python programming language to develop a simple yet functional calculator capable of performing various arithmetic operations. The calculator prompts the user to input two numbers and specify the desired operation to be performed. Upon receiving these inputs, it processes the data and outputs the calculated result.

The calculator supports basic arithmetic operations, allowing users to add, subtract, multiply, or divide the two input numbers. This project demonstrates fundamental programming concepts, including user input handling, conditional statements, and basic mathematical operations in Python.
